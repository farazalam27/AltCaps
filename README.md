# AlternatingCaps iMessage Extension

> Trolling your friends—one perfectly alternated message at a time.

## 🚀 Overview

**AlternatingCaps** is a lightweight iMessage app that takes any pasted text and transforms it into that classic “gEt A jOb” alternating-caps style. Built in Swift with a true-black UI and haptic feedback, it’s the fastest way to troll your buddies with minimal effort.

## 🔥 Features

- **Sleek Dark Mode UI**  
  True-black background, dark-grey rounded bubble and button for a stealthy look.

- **Haptic Feedback**  
  A satisfying tap vibration when your transformed text is launched.

- **Auto-Send**  
  No more copy-paste gymnastics—your transformed text drops straight into the conversation.

- **Placeholder Hint**  
  “Paste a message here…” guides you to where to drop your text.
